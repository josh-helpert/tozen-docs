Q:

## Functions
### Derived

One goal of Tozen is to move more computation into the static domain.
One way this is done is with derived computations.

### Constraints and Guarantees

At this level we aim to provide very strong guarantees by the compiler.
In order to the compiler to reason about user functions, they must conform to a number of constraints.
Although the constraints appear to be overly restrictive; a surprising amount of code fall into these constraints.

Essentially we must be able to guarantee that a function always succeeds.
Often this means it is total (each input has an output) but not exclusively.

These categories of functions can be fully reasoned about:
* comptime known: are values which are knowable by the compiler
  * often this includes:
    * `literals`
    * `const`
    * `comptime`
    * static data structures like:
      * `Array`
      * `Struct`
  * eg `sum` using comptime known
    ```
    x  = 1 // comptime known b/c literal
    #y = 2 // comptime knwon b/c comptime variable

    sum(x, #y)
    ```
* total: every input maps to some output (without error?)
  * eg static substitution
    ```
    age :U8 = 32

    msg = "user age is \(age)"
    ```
* traversals
  * only non-branching?
* knowable ranges?
* 

There are also functions which one would expect to be included but aren't.
The reason is because often these have implicit costs.
Here are some examples:
* Arithmetic
  * There are implicit costs and failure conditions like:
    * overflow/underflow
    * divide by zero
    * undefined behavior when mixing different numeric types
* Unions
  * Such as:
    * Wrappers
    * Results
    * Optional
    * Exception Values
  * Any type of union implicitly has a memory cost.
    This is because either the union must use indirection or inconsistent memory access.
* 

In cases that a conflict is detected a comptime error will be emitted.
For example, consider computing the total of a `Array`:
```
arr       = [100, 100, 100]
//arr       = [rand(0, 255), rand(0, 255), rand(0, 255)]
total :U8 = arr/0 + arr/1 + arr/2
```
The compiler will emit an error b/c it can be determined that total will overflow.



Unknowable
* non-deterministic
* mutation
* potentially invalid
  * undefined behaviour
  * overflow/underflow
  * divide-by-zero
  * infinities
  * error/exception free
* unclear dev intent
  * eg overflow is implicit in `U8` but should be explicit in behavior?
  * usage in each case but also related to data itself. It really depends on use-case?

Types of knowable functions:
* internal merge?
  * fold?
  * or? doesn't this have a cost b/c union has a memory cost?
  * known safe ops?
* range?
  * values which are known to not cause issues w/ specific ops?
* output known to be in some type
  * eg `"my age is \(age)"` must be `Int -> String`
* total?
  * every input must be able to map to an output
  * all output of the same type?
* edge-cases have been tested and modeled as output?
  * eg `Optional`? like `3 / x` becomes `Optional(Float)` b/c `x` could be `0`?
  * could be all types of errors, each need to be modeled in some way!
  * could also be modeled as outputs to multiple domains which could both be written to?
  * Handling things like this have a cost thought? or can be erased?
* comptime known
  * literals
  * comptime/const
* known bounds
  * this is related to comptime known
  * eg where you know the bounds will not be exceeded
    ```
    x = 4
    y = 6

    // never beyond U8 max and knowable
    z :U8 = sum(x, y)
    ```
* look into solvers (SMT)
* enumeration-functions but not their bodies
  * eg map is fine as long as body of map uses function which will always succeed
  * but there's also a cost in just enumeration (eg ADT or Tagged Union?)
    * even representing mixed memory is an issue? dev must be explicit?
* function must always succeed
  * or at least map them to an error value and union them?
* 

They must be:
* total
* associate?
* commutative?
* deterministic?


## Lambda
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
* usage
  * pattern matching
    * how names are passed to a handler where the handler is a type of lambda?
  * 
* ideally the function and lambda syntax are nearly the same?
  * that way the meta pattern is `fn-name = lambda-syntax`?
    * with an optional name or body? how to differentiate? just the last expression is always the body and if middle then it's function output?
      * like input, optional output, must include body
    * if `Fn` then read as `(in -> out, body)` but if not then is lambda of `(in -> body)`?
* syntax
  ```
  // Function delimiter?
  (x, y) -> (x + x)

  // use `=>` (fat arrow)
  (x, y) => (x + y) // lambda?
  (x, y) =>         // lambda?
    x + y

  // use `#fn`
  #fn(x, y) -> (x + y)
  #fn(x, y) ->
    (x + y)

  #fn(x, y) | x + y
  #fn(x, y)
    (x + y)

  // use `#do`
  #do(x, y) -> (x + y)
  #do(x, y) ->
    (x + y)

  #do(x, y) | x + y
  #do(x, y) |
    (x + y)

  #f(x -> x + 1)

  x :Int = 0, y :Int = 1 -> abs(x - y)
  (x :Int = 0, y :Int = 1 -> abs(x - y))
  #f(x :Int = 0, y :Int = 1 -> abs(x - y))
  #fn(x :Int = 0, y :Int = 1 -> abs(x - y))

  #f(x, (x + 1))
  ```

    ),

// Mixed destructure
let ((feet, inches), Point { x, y }) = ((3, 10), Point { x: 3, y: -10 });

    }
}

### Enum/(Generics/Polymorphism)

```
// OCaml
type 'a tree =
    | Leaf
    | Node of 'a tree * 'a * 'a tree;;

let t = Node (Node (Leaf, 1, Leaf), 2, Node (Node (Leaf, 3, Leaf), 4, Leaf));;

// Tozen
Tree = #do
  T :TypeCapture

  Enum
    Leaf = _
    Node = (Tree(T), T, Tree(T))

t = Node(Node(Leaf, 1, Leaf), 2, Node(Node(Leaf, 3, Leaf), 4, Leaf)) // all ()
t = Node Node(Leaf, 1, Leaf), 2, Node Node(Leaf, 3, Leaf), 4, Leaf   // drop outermost ()
t = Node Node Leaf, 1, Leaf; 2, Node Node Leaf, 3, Leaf; 4, Leaf     // drop all ()
```

### Enum/Memory

For the targets which manage memory, the layout of `Enum`s don't match the order of fields.

Instead the compiler attempts to create an optimal layout.

For those languages where memory layout needs to be explicit the developer can use modifiers like:
```
StopLight #(packed = False, = Enum
  Green  = 0
  Yellow = 1
  Red    = 2
```

### GADT

```
// Haskell

    EBool  :: Bool     -> Expr Bool
    EInt   :: Int      -> Expr Int
    EEqual :: Expr Int -> Expr Int  -> Expr Bool

eval :: Expr a -> a

eval e = case e of
    EBool a    -> a
    EInt a     -> a
    EEqual a b -> (eval a) == (eval b)

expr1 = EEqual (EInt 2) (EInt 3)        -- the type of ex

## Union
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q:
* Should a ADT (or GADT) replace both Enum and Union?
* There an efficiency case for Union? or just for c compatibility?
* All similar ideas:
  * Keyword
    * Names w/o values
  * Enum
    * Names potentially w/o values
      * needs to have an integer value?
    * or like a Range w/o names?
    * enums are also used for things like bit flags but we may be able to use other constructs?
  * ADT
    * Name w/ diff fields over a union
  * Tagged Union
    * Name w/ diff fields over a union
  * Range
    * ranges are over values but not over names?
  * Static Records
* Zig basics
  * Primitives
  * Constructs
    * Array
    * Vector
    * Pointer
    * Slice
    * Struct
    * Enum
    * Union
    * Optional
    * Error & ErrorSet
  * Behavior

    * each call is actually just passing stack variables to hidden function

  * `path = raw"~/dev/{username}/test"` pass to function `raw`?
* Tuple as reification of Record as data and fully static?

    * much like hole?
  * declare multiple and combine
    * compiler will merge into 1 allocation for you?
  * concat, spread, merge, etc.
    * related to varargs and rest operators as well!

* can't require file header b/c of interpreter directives?
  * then really is the first set of dashes?
* implicit casts/peer type resolution
  * widening: I8 + I16 => I16
  * resolve const and non-const to const
  * and many others?
* global increments and categories of increments
  * diff units of counts
    * entire program/in-memory
    * phases
    * modules

## Fixed Memory Cast
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Notes:
* Same memory start and end
* The same memory can be rewritten to new interpretation as long as there's space (statically known)
* Like Zig union which can pick the active interpretation?
* Also can reinterpret to another as long as memory aligns
  * could evn require a copy for memory which isn't compliant?
* In cases where it can't, fails at comptime?
  * A runtime version as well which can be Result and potentially fail?
